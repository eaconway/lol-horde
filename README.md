Welcome to the LoL: Horde Mode (League of Legends)

# Background and Overview
LoL: Horde Mode is an interactive game where a user is tasked to get rid of all of the enemies before moving onto the next level. The idea is to clear the level being killed by the enemies. All combatants will have access to guns (ranged) or can kill you by touch (melee).

The game is called LoL: Horde Mode because the character will be a league of legends character head shooting other characters in the game.

The main player can move around as much as they like within the level. They're able to jump on platforms around the map, but so are the enemies. As the levels progress, more enemies will come to attack you.

Overall, I wanted a project that would really challenge my abilities in a new way, but also one that fit my interests. This game combines some interesting aspects from a few different games overall, the main 2 being: player movements and platforms, shooting/touch death animations.

# Architecture and Technologies

In order to get the project up and running, I'll be implementing the following technologies:
- Vanilla JS for overall structure and logic
- HTML5 Canvas for DOM manipulation and rendering
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts
- Bonus: 

There will be a few primary files:
- Map: this will house all pieces from players, to enemies
- Levels: this file will house different configurations of the map, inserting different platforms where needed
- Player: this file will manage how a player moves and interacts with the game
- Enemies: this file will manage how enemies interact with the game and player
